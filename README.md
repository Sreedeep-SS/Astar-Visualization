# Astar-Visualization

It is a beginner guided project that I have created using python and pygame module. It focuses on visualizing A* path finding algorithm between 2 points in a grid. It allows the users to designate intial and end point. The users can also assign barriers and the algorithm will find the shortest path towards the end point using the algorithm.
